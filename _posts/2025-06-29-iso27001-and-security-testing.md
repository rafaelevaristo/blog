# ISO27001-2022: Simple Security Testing for Compliance

In my organization, itâ€™s my responsibility to ensure that the solutions we develop maintain a security posture compliant with multiple standards, including ISO27001. We already have several technical controls in placeâ€”such as code quality checks, DAST, SAST, supply chain security, etc.

Recently, I wanted to add security testing directly mapped to ISO27001 controls, specifically:

* A.8.24 (Use of Cryptography)
* A.8.25 (Secure System Engineering Principles)
* A.8.26 (Application Security Requirements)
* A.8.29 (Security Testing in Development and Acceptance)

Iâ€™m not trying to replace or compete with existing tools. Instead, these tests give me a practical, code-based perspective on the ISO controls. Iâ€™ve found this approach to be a great way to kickstart discussions and bridge the gap between the theoretical world of ISMS ( Information Security Management System ) and the practical and technical perspectives of developers and QA engineers.
