# Vibe Coding: A Classic Developer’s Perspective

Everyone seems to be talking about *vibe coding* these days—and how the arrival of tools like ChatGPT 5 might spell the end for traditional developers. So, I decided to dive in and see for myself what this new approach is all about.

I’ve been an engineer for half my life. I've designed and implemented all kinds of systems, using Gang of Four patterns, SOLID principles, DRY code, and even the occasional anti-pattern (for educational purposes, of course 😄 ). You name it, I’ve probably built it.

But this time, I wanted to break away from the dogma and *truly* try something different. I wanted to understand if vibe coding makes sense in a real-world scenario—and what its impact could be on productivity, culture, and the classic trio of **People, Process, and Technology**.

### The Experiment

I started with the following prompt:

> *"You are an expert full-stack software engineer with deep knowledge of cryptography, X.509 certificates, and secure web development. I want you to help me build a web-based Certificate Management Application. The application will allow users to generate key pairs and CSRs, manage certificate authorities (CAs), and issue certificates for different purposes."*

I fed this prompt into two major LLMs:

* **Claude 4**
* **Gemini CLI** (powered by Gemini Pro 2.5)

And then I watched them work.

### What I Learned

Here are my key takeaways from this 4-hour session:

* **Gemini** isn’t ideal for starting projects from scratch. It often jumps into complex territory too quickly, and that breaks the *vibe*. Things usually don’t run on the first try, which can kill momentum.

* **Claude 4**, on the other hand, delivered more coherent and understandable code. It felt like working with a colleague who prioritizes clarity over cleverness. That made it easier—and more enjoyable—for me to keep iterating, improving the design, and adding new features.
  *(To borrow the wise words of Donald Knuth: “Premature optimization is the root of all evil.”)*

* If I were to build an *agentic* AI team, I’d cast **Claude 4** as the *architect*, and **Gemini** as the *developer*—someone who takes the architectural vision and enhances it, optimizing and expanding it while preserving the original intent.

### Reflections

This experience convinced me of one thing: **we’re getting close**.

Machines are already becoming better than most humans at writing functional code. What they lack—for now—is *judgment*, *creativity*, and *critical thinking*. That’s where humans will still play an essential role: ideating, validating, guiding, and ensuring the outputs align with real-world constraints.

To my fellow engineers:
**Start now. Experiment. Be curious.** Don’t reject this wave just because it looks different. If you resist change too long, you risk becoming obsolete. Let these tools free you—from obsessively applying every pattern, from manually avoiding every anti-pattern—and focus instead on being *human* again.
